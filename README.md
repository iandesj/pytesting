# Pytesting

Project with a few examples of unit testing

1. Clone this repo
2. checkout `main` branch
   - Example: single test
   - Activity: assert the length of result in the test
   - Lesson: testing the behavior of a function
3. checkout `one` branch
   - Example: single test
   - Activity: assert the list data in the test
   - Lesson: testing the behavior of a function (cont'd)
4. checkout `two` branch
   - Example: single test
5. checkout `three` branch
   - Example: multiple tests, two failing
   - Activity: modify `parse_students_file` function so all tests pass
   - Lesson: Using tests as a source of truth for intended function behavior. Tests help you understand the design of the code
6. checkout `four` branch
   - Example: multiple passing tests
   - Activity: refactor `parser` module
   - Lesson: Using tests to make code changes quickly
7. checkout `five` branch
   - Example: multiple passing tests
   - Activity: refactor `parser` module further
   - Lesson: Using tests to make code changes quickly (cont'd)
8. checkout `six` branch
